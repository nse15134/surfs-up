# Overview of the Analysis
 In this challenge, we will be working with Pandas and SQLAlchemy,  We want to be able to retrieve the data from the hawaii.sqllite database for the months of June and December.  We want to be able to determine if the surf and ice cream business is sustainable year-round.  We will do this by converting the temperatures for those months into a list and we can generate the entire list by date, and we can also create a summary statistics table.
